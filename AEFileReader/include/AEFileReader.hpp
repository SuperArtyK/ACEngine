/** @file AEFileReader/include/AEFileReader.hpp
 *  This file contains the code for the engine's file reader.
 *  Which is just a small wrapper around the c's FILE api, for speed and convenience.
 *  One note when using it though: file is blocked from access by other programs when open.
 *  But maybe that's a good feature ;)
 *
 *  Should not cause everything to break :)
