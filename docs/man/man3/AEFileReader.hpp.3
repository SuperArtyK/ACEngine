.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
This file contains the code for the engine's file reader\&. Which is just a small wrapper around the c's FILE api, for speed and convenience\&. One note when using it though: file is blocked from access by other programs when open\&. But maybe that's a good feature ;)
.PP
Should not cause everything to break :)
